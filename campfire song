Hello Muddah 
Hello Faddah
Here I am at camp granada
Camp is very entertaining, 
and they say we'll have some fun if it stops raining 
I went hiking with Joe Spivey
He developed poisen ivy 
You remember Leonard Skinner
he got ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner
All the counsellors hate the waiters,
and the lake has alligators,
and the head coach wants no sissies
So he reads to us from something called Ulysses
Now I don't want this should scare ya,
But my bunkmate has malaria
You remember Jeffery Hardy
They are about to organize a searching party
Take me home, oh Maddah, Faddah, 
take me home, I hate granada 
Don't leave me in the forest where 
I might get eaten by a bear
Take me home, I promise I will 
not make noise, or mess the house with other boys
Oh please don't make me stay 
I have been here one whole day
